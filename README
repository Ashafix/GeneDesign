GeneDesign development branch

installation prereqs:
from cpan: GD::Graph, Perl6::Slurp, List::MoreUtils, Spreadsheet::ParseExcel, Spreadsheet::WriteExcel

gdOliReDes and gdFusionDes are not working!  I'm not sure that we need either one anymore although primer picking is a nice function I think.


To Do:
-put all variables into hash that makes carrying through "design a gene" much much simpler"
-curate enzyme list
